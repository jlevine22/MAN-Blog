Hello World! This is the first post of my new MAN blogging system. MAN stands for markdown, angular, and node because that’s how real men blog.

### Why MAN?
To be honest, why not? I’ve been looking for things to build in node.js and a simple blogging platform seemed a good place to start. I wanted to keep it simple and avoid using a database. I can write in markdown and use a git repository to store all my posts.
